# Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

This repository contains a simple Pythagorean theorem calculator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator takes input for two sides of a triangle and calculates the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Usage

1. Open the `pythagorean.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the length of side 1 in the input field provided.
3. Enter the length of side 2 in the input field provided.
4. Click the "Calculate" button.
5. The result, which is the length of the third side, will be displayed below the button.
