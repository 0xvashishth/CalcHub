Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. 
The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigen√®re square or Vigenere table. When the vigenere table is given, the encryption and decryption are done using the vigenere table (26 * 26 matrix) in this method.
