### Numerical Methods Calculator

### Functionality :-
- The calculator allows you to approximate the solution of a first-order ordinary differential equation using different numerical methods. It provides a visual representation of how the numerical methods approximate the solution by evaluating the function at discrete intervals.
- Enter Valin inputs and Select one of the numerical methods - Euler's method, Euler's modified method, or Runge-Kutta's method. This determines the algorithm used to approximate the solution of the differential equation.
