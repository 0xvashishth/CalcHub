# Resonant Frequency Calculator

This calculator calculates the Resonant Frequency by taking Capacitance and Inductance. The answer given by the calculator is very accurate.

## About the Resonant Frequency :

Resonant frequency is the oscillation of a system at its natural or unforced resonance. Resonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between different storage modes, such as Kinetic energy or Potential energy as you would find with a simple pendulum.

The Resonant associated with an object is calculated as follows : fr = 1/ (2ℼ √LC)

where fr - Resonanat frequency, L  - Inductance, C  - Capacitance

## Inputs required for calculator:

1) Capacitance in Farads
2) Inductance in Henries
