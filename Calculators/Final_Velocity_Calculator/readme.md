# FINAL VELOCITY CALCULATOR 

- A simple website made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript to calcualate a final velocity by taking initial velocity, acceleration and time as input.

# Calculator Use and Functionalities
This velocity calculator uses the equation that the final velocity of an object is equal to its initial velocity added to its acceleration multiplied by time of travel. This calculator does assume constant acceleration during the time traveled.

# Built With :-
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Bootstrap

# Velocity Equation in these calculations:
Final velocity (v) of an object equals initial velocity (u) of that object plus acceleration (a) of the object times the elapsed time (t) from u to v.

# Formula => v=u+at
Where:
- u = initial velocity
- v = final velocity
- a = acceleration
- t = time
