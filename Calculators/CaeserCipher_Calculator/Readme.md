The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. 
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

Working - 
1)First give input text(Plaintext)
2)Provide integer key
3)Click in the last row and you will get the required output(encrypted text).
